# Data Engineering Fundamentals

Data engineering is the foundation that makes data science possible. This course teaches you to build reliable, scalable data pipelines that transform raw data into analytics-ready datasets.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand data engineering principles and the modern data stack
- Design and implement ETL/ELT pipelines for batch and streaming data
- Work with data warehouses and analytical databases
- Build data pipelines with Apache Airflow
- Process large-scale data with Apache Spark
- Transform data with dbt (data build tool)
- Implement data quality and testing frameworks
- Design data architectures for scalability and reliability

## Prerequisites

- Python for Data Science course
- SQL Data Analysis course
- Basic understanding of databases
- Command line proficiency
