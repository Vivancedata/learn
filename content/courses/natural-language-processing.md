# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This course takes you from text preprocessing fundamentals to cutting-edge transformer architectures.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand core NLP concepts and the text processing pipeline
- Implement text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization)
- Work with word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)
- Build sentiment analysis and text classification models
- Understand the transformer architecture and attention mechanisms
- Fine-tune pre-trained language models (BERT, GPT)
- Implement named entity recognition (NER) and question answering
- Deploy NLP models to production

## Prerequisites

- Machine Learning Fundamentals course (or equivalent)
- Strong Python programming skills
- Understanding of neural networks basics
- Familiarity with PyTorch or TensorFlow

## Course Structure

### Section 1: Text Processing Fundamentals
Learn the essential text preprocessing pipeline including tokenization, normalization, and feature extraction.

### Section 2: Word Representations
Understand how to represent words as vectors using traditional and neural approaches.

### Section 3: Text Classification
Build classifiers for sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization.

### Section 4: Sequence Models for NLP
Apply RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs to language modeling and sequence labeling tasks.

### Section 5: Transformers and Attention
Deep dive into the transformer architecture that powers modern NLP.

### Section 6: Pre-trained Language Models
Learn to use and fine-tune BERT, GPT, and other foundation models.

### Section 7: Advanced NLP Applications
Build NER systems, question answering, text summarization, and chatbots.
