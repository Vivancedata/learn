- Create SEO-optimized content at scale

**Example Workflow**:
```
1. Outline: "Create a detailed outline for a blog post on [topic]"
2. Draft: "Write the introduction section based on this outline"
3. Refine: "Make this more engaging and add a concrete example"
4. SEO: "Suggest 10 keywords to naturally include in this article"
```

**Marketing Copy**:
- Product descriptions
- Email campaigns
- Social media posts
- Ad variations for A/B testing
