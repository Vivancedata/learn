## Avoiding Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Tool Overload
**Problem:** Subscribing to 10 tools, using none well

**Solution:** Start with 2-3 tools, master them, then expand

### Mistake #2: Paying for Overlapping Features
**Problem:** ChatGPT Plus + Claude Pro + Gemini Advanced

**Solution:** Choose ONE general assistant, supplement with specialized tools

### Mistake #3: Not Exploring Free Tiers
**Problem:** Paying for premium when free tier suffices

**Solution:** Start free, upgrade when you hit limits

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Integration
**Problem:** Tools that don't work together

**Solution:** Choose tools that integrate (Notion + Notion AI, ChatGPT + Zapier, etc.)

### Mistake #5: Following Every New Launch
**Problem:** Constantly switching tools, never building expertise

**Solution:** Pick stable, established tools; evaluate new tools quarterly
