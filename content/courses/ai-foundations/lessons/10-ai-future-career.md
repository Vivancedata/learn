# The Future of AI and Your Career

AI is transforming the world of work faster than any previous technology. This lesson helps you prepare for an AI-powered future, understand what's coming, and position yourself for success.

## Where AI is Heading (2024-2030)

### Near-Term (1-2 years)

**More Capable Models**
