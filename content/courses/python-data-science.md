# Python for Data Science

Python has become the dominant language for data science, and for good reason. This course teaches you Python specifically for data analysis—from fundamentals to practical data science workflows.

## Learning Outcomes

- Write Python code confidently for data analysis tasks
- Use NumPy for numerical computing and array operations
- Master Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Create compelling data visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Clean and prepare real-world messy data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Load, transform, and export data from various sources
- Apply Python to solve real data problems

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer skills
- Familiarity with spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets) helpful but not required
- No prior programming experience needed
- Willingness to practice coding regularly
