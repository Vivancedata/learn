# MLOps and Model Deployment

MLOps bridges the gap between ML experimentation and production systems. This course teaches you to deploy, monitor, and maintain ML models at scale.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the MLOps lifecycle and key principles
- Package ML models with Docker for consistent deployment
- Build CI/CD pipelines for ML with GitHub Actions
- Serve models as REST APIs using FastAPI and TorchServe
- Implement model versioning and experiment tracking with MLflow
- Set up model monitoring and alerting for drift detection
- Deploy models to cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Build automated ML pipelines with orchestration tools

## Prerequisites

- Machine Learning Fundamentals course
- Python programming proficiency
- Basic understanding of APIs and web services
- Familiarity with Git and command line

## Course Structure

### Section 1: MLOps Fundamentals
Understand the ML lifecycle, technical debt, and why production ML is hard.

### Section 2: Environment and Dependency Management
Master virtual environments, dependency pinning, and reproducible setups.

### Section 3: Containerization with Docker
Package models and dependencies into portable containers.

### Section 4: Model Serving
Deploy models as APIs with FastAPI, Flask, TorchServe, and TensorFlow Serving.

### Section 5: Experiment Tracking and Model Registry
Track experiments and manage model versions with MLflow.

### Section 6: CI/CD for Machine Learning
Automate testing, training, and deployment pipelines.

### Section 7: Model Monitoring and Maintenance
Detect data drift, monitor performance, and trigger retraining.

### Section 8: Cloud Deployment
Deploy to AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI, and Azure ML.

## Why Learn MLOps?

**Production Reality**: 87% of ML projects never make it to production

**High Demand**: MLOps engineers are among the most sought-after roles ($160k-$250k+)

**Bridge the Gap**: Connect data science with software engineering best practices

**Career Growth**: Essential skill for senior ML roles and ML platform teams

**Real Impact**: Turn models from notebooks into business value

## Time Commitment

- **Total Duration**: 40 hours
- **Recommended Pace**: 6-8 hours per week
- **Course Length**: 5-7 weeks at recommended pace
- **Format**: Self-paced with hands-on projects

## What You'll Build

Throughout this course, you'll create production-ready ML systems:
- Dockerized ML API with FastAPI
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- MLflow tracking server and model registry
- Real-time model monitoring dashboard
- Automated retraining pipeline
- Multi-model A/B testing system

## Tools You'll Use

**Python** (v3.10+): Primary programming language
**Docker**: Containerization
**FastAPI**: API framework
**MLflow**: Experiment tracking and registry
**GitHub Actions**: CI/CD
**Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitoring
**AWS/GCP**: Cloud deployment
