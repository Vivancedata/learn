# Generative AI & LLM Applications

Large Language Models are revolutionizing software development. This course teaches you to build powerful applications using GPT, Claude, and open-source models.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand how LLMs work and their capabilities/limitations
- Master prompt engineering for reliable results
- Build applications using OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source APIs
- Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- Fine-tune models for specific tasks
- Build chatbots, agents, and AI-powered workflows
- Handle evaluation, safety, and production deployment
- Understand costs and optimize for efficiency

## Prerequisites

- Python programming skills
- Basic understanding of APIs and HTTP requests
- Familiarity with JSON data format
- No machine learning background required (helpful but not necessary)

## Course Structure

### Section 1: Understanding LLMs
How LLMs work, capabilities, limitations, and choosing the right model.

### Section 2: Prompt Engineering
Techniques for getting reliable, high-quality outputs from LLMs.

### Section 3: Working with LLM APIs
OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and open-source model integration.

### Section 4: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Build systems that combine LLMs with your own data.

### Section 5: Agents and Tool Use
Create AI agents that can take actions and use external tools.

### Section 6: Production Deployment
Evaluation, safety, monitoring, and cost optimization.
